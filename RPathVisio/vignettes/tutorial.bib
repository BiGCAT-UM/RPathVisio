Abstract = {{Background: Biological pathways are a useful abstraction of biological
   concepts, and software tools to deal with pathway diagrams can help
   biological research. PathVisio is a new visualization tool for
   biological pathways that mimics the popular GenMAPP tool with a
   completely new Java implementation that allows better integration with
   other open source projects. The GenMAPP MAPP file format is replaced by
   GPML, a new XML file format that provides seamless exchange of graphical
   pathway information among multiple programs.
   Results: PathVisio can be combined with other bioinformatics tools to
   open up three possible uses: visual compilation of biological knowledge,
   interpretation of high-throughput expression datasets, and computational
   augmentation of pathways with interaction information. PathVisio is open
   source software and available at http://www.pathvisio.org.
   Conclusion: PathVisio is a graphical editor for biological pathways,
   with flexibility and ease of use as primary goals.}},
